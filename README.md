# xSafe Predictive Deployer

Deterministic Multi-Chain Deployment

FRONTEND:

WE ALSO HANDLE SIGNATURES CAREFULLY ON FRONTEND

-   MINIMIZE RISK OF SIGNATURES GETTING STOLEN
-   AFTER SIGNING, PROMPT TRANSACTION. IF SUBMITTED, CLEAR STATE. IF NOT, CLEAR STATE, PROMPT SIGN AGAIN.

CONTRACTS:

WE ONLY ACCEPT SIGNATURES RELEVANT TO OUR SPECIFIC CONTRACT FUNCTIONALITY

-   NO ACTIONS CAN TAKE PLACE THAT WERE NOT DIRECTLY AUTHORIZED
-   STOLEN SIGNATURES, FOR OTHER MEANS, DO NOT PROMPT DEPLOYMENTS ON OUR FACTORY CONTRACT

WE MANDATE THAT ONLY SIGNER AND XSAFE CAN SUBMIT SIGNATURES FOR DEPLOYMENT

-   THE POWER TO EXECUTE A DEPOYMENT IS LIMITED TO SALT PRIVATE KEY HOLDER AND XSAFE

DEPLOYMENT REQUIRES SIGNATURE, NOT ADDRESS DIRECTLY

-   SALT IS A FUNCTION OF ADDRESS - ANY ONE CAN SUBMIT AN ADDRESS. ONLY PRIVATE KEY HOLDER CAN SUBMIT SIGNATURE
-   WITH SIGNATURE METHOD, THE ONLY WAY TO OBTAIN A SALT, TIED TO AN ADDRESS, IS TO OWN THAT ADDRESS' PRIVATE KEY
-   ONLY RIGHTFUL OWNERS CAN DEPLOY THEIR CONTRACTS AT THEIR DETERMINISTIC ADDRESSES
